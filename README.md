# coop-receipt-manager
Manages receipts associated with your coop.dk account.

# Usage
By default it will list all your transactions. Furthermore it will show you much money you've spent in total and in the last 7/14/30 days. At last it'll show the complete receipt for your last transaction.
This behavior can easily be changed in `Example/program.cs`.

Remember to update `Example/CredentialManager.cs` to include your Coop.dk credentials.
